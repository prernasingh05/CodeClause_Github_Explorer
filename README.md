# Github Explorer
This project is a web application that allows users to retrieve information about a GitHub user by entering their username.
It leverages the GitHub API to interact with GitHub's resources and retrieve user-specific data.
The application provides an interface where users can input a GitHub username and initiate the retrieval process.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Functionality
To use this application enter the username into the search input field and hit `search` button or press enter. Upon receiving the username, the application sends a request to the GitHub API, specifically targeting the user endpoint. 
The API responds with the user's details, such as their name, bio, location, repositories, followers, and other relevant 
information. The application then processes this response and displays the retrieved data on the web page.

By combining the power of the GitHub API and web development technologies, this project provides an interactive and dynamic 
way for users to quickly obtain information about any GitHub user by simply entering their username.
